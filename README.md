This portfolio was created as a way to showcase my skills in using HTML and CSS to create a stylish and functional webpage containing information about myself, my work as a web developer, and links to my contact information. This webapge contains information about me, a showcase of my current portfolio, and links for potential employers to contact me. 

To create this page, I used HTML and CSS to create and design the webpage. I used a gradient background to mimic a sunset. I designed the page layout to resemble a social media profile as my design choice. I added a smooth scrool for an aesthetic effect. I added my name and profile photo to the side of the page and then positioned my page content to sit next to this. 

By completing this project, I feel as though I was able to consolidate my skills in HTML and CSS by creating a webpage from scratch for the first time. By using elements such as flexboxes and media screens, I was able to create a page that is reactive to various screen sizes whilst ensuring the content is readable and functional. I was able to grasp an understanding on the importance of ensuring web pages are visually appealing on all screen sizes. 

To ensure this webpage meets accessibility requirements, I have added alt tags to each image, commented on each CSS element, and ensured the CSS file follows the same structure as the HTML. 

Within this repository, you will find:
- Links to the live webpage of my About Me site
- Screenshots of the webpage
- HTML and CSS coding associated with the page
- This README (obviously!)
- An assets folder, containing images used in the webpage
